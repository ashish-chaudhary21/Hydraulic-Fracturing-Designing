# Hydraulic-Fracturing-Designing

Created a template which can be used to calculate Formation Breakdown Pressure by using Overburden pressure.

We could also calculate Surface treatment pressure and Horsepower required for the pump to perform the Hydraulic
Fracturing Job.

Implemented the knowledge of proppant stress to create a model which may assist the selection of proppant for
Hydraulic Fracturing Job.
